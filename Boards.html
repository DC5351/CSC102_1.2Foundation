        <h1>These are the program objectives for Network Engineering.</h1>
        <p>
            1. Analyze the business needs of the organization while applying appropriate tools and frameworks to create solutions. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            2. Develop cloud infrastructure using appropriate orchestration tools that focus on emphasizing the best benefits of remote infrastructure. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            3. Integrate software development frameworks designed to exploit the horizontal scaling of cloud computing. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            4. Develop communication skills that facilitate the understanding of complex technology-related topics by laymen, as well as being able to provide technical writing when appropriate.
        </p> 
        <p>    
            5. Design communications environments that incorporate all facets of enterprise needs to include traditional networking but also account for needs and security within IoT, mobile devices, and integration of non-enterprise-owned devices. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            6. Develop all solutions with a security-first attitude while using best practices such as test-driven development.
        </p>

        <h1>These are the program objectives for Network Security.</h1>    
        <p>
            1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components, connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media), and addressing, including operational and security components in the design. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            2. Install, configure, and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners, vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch management, auditing, and assessment. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            3. Construct, implement, and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing, analysis, and assessment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, assessments, or troubleshooting procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements that pertain to information security. 
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Research, document, test, and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques, or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
